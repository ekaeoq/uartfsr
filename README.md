# Short Comparative Analysis of Human Touch and Centered Weight Measurements on an FSR402 Sensor
## About FSR402 (Force Sensing Resistor)
As suggested by its name, an FSR sensor reacts to force. More precisely, it acts as a "resistor" that changes its resistance when force is applied. The more force applied, the less resistance it exhibits.<br /> 


This sensor is not precise and is not intended for use in precise applications. It primarily works well with human touch, with an error margin of about 5% to 25%, when doing repeated tests though, it's closer to
15% - 25%.
