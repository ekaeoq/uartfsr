# Short Comparative Analysis of Human Touch and Centered Weight Measurements on an FSR402 Sensor
## About FSR402 (Force Sensing Resistor)
As suggested by its name, an FSR sensor reacts to force. More precisely, it acts as a "resistor" that changes its resistance when force is applied. The more force applied, the less resistance it exhibits.<br /> 


This sensor is not precise and is not intended for use in precise applications. It primarily works well with human touch, with an error margin of about 5% to 25%, when doing repeated tests though, it's closer to
15% - 25%.

### <b>Measurement 4: 750g</b><br />
(the reason this shit flactuates more if prlly cuz the shit was unstable)

Received value: 3248<br /> 
Received value: 3238<br /> 
Received value: 3238<br /> 
Received value: 3237<br /> 
Received value: 3245<br />

Received value: 3245<br /> 
Received value: 3243<br /> 
Received value: 3239<br /> 
Received value: 3245<br /> 
<b>Resulting in a average of: 3242.3</b>

Notes:
Observation on Fluctuations:
The measurements for 750g show greater fluctuations, likely due to instability during the measurement process.
