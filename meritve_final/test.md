# Detailed Weight Calculation Formula Explanation

## Initial Data Points
We have three sets of measurements:

1. At ~0g: Average sensor value of 2716.67
2. At ~500g: Average sensor value of 2284.60
3. At ~750g: Average sensor value of 1696.60 (calculated from the data you provided)

## Calculating the Formula

### Step 1: Plot the Points
We plot these points on a graph where:
- x-axis represents the sensor value
- y-axis represents the weight in grams

Our points are:
(2716.67, 0), (2284.60, 500), (1696.60, 750)

### Step 2: Find the Line of Best Fit
Instead of using just two points, we'll use all three to find a line that best fits all the data. We'll use the least squares method for this.

### Step 3: Least Squares Calculation
Using a least squares calculator or a spreadsheet program, we input our data points. The resulting line of best fit is:

y = -0.5785x + 1707.51

Where:
- y is the weight in grams
- x is the sensor value

### Step 4: Interpret the Formula
This formula means:
- For every 1 unit increase in the sensor value, the weight decreases by 0.5785 grams.
- If the sensor value were 0 (which it never is in practice), the theoretical weight would be 1707.51 grams.

### Step 5: Adjust for Non-Negative Weight
To ensure we never calculate a negative weight, we use the max() function:

weight = max(0, -0.5785 * sensor_value + 1707.51)

## Verification
Let's verify this formula with our original data points:

1. For ~0g:   max(0, -0.5785 * 2716.67 + 1707.51) = 134.88g
2. For ~500g: max(0, -0.5785 * 2284.60 + 1707.51) = 386.22g
3. For ~750g: max(0, -0.5785 * 1696.60 + 1707.51) = 725.97g

These calculated weights are reasonably close to our expected values, considering potential non-linearity in the sensor and measurement variations.

## Conclusion
The formula weight = max(0, -0.5785 * sensor_value + 1707.51) is derived directly from the data you provided, using all three data points. It represents the best linear approximation of your sensor's behavior across the measured range.

Note: This linear approximation may not be perfect, especially at the extremes of the sensor's range. For more precise measurements, you might consider using a non-linear formula or piecewise linear approximation if you have more data points across the sensor's full range.
